ECLIPSE ANDROID PROJECT IMPORT SUMMARY
======================================

Risky Project Location:
-----------------------
The tools *should* handle project locations in any directory. However,
due to bugs, placing projects in directories containing spaces in the
path, or characters like ", ' and &, have had issues. We're working to
eliminate these bugs, but to save yourself headaches you may want to
move your project to a location where this is not a problem.

Ignored Files:
--------------
The following files were *not* copied into the new Gradle project; you
should evaluate whether these are still needed in your project and if
so manually move them:

* UniversalLoaderLib.iml
* pom.xml
* test-gen/
* test-gen/com/
* test-gen/com/nostra13/
* test-gen/com/nostra13/universalimageloader/
* test-gen/com/nostra13/universalimageloader/R.java
* test/
* test/com/
* test/com/nostra13/
* test/com/nostra13/universalimageloader/
* test/com/nostra13/universalimageloader/core/
* test/com/nostra13/universalimageloader/core/assist/
* test/com/nostra13/universalimageloader/core/assist/ImageSizeTest.java
* test/com/nostra13/universalimageloader/core/download/
* test/com/nostra13/universalimageloader/core/download/BaseImageDownloaderTest.java

Moved Files:
------------
Android Gradle projects use a different directory structure than ADT
Eclipse projects. Here's how the projects were restructured:

* AndroidManifest.xml => universalLoaderLib/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml
* assets/ => universalLoaderLib/src/main/assets
* res/ => universalLoaderLib/src/main/res
* src/ => universalLoaderLib/src/main/java/

Next Steps:
-----------
You can now build the project. The Gradle project needs network
connectivity to download dependencies.

Bugs:
-----
If for some reason your project does not build, and you determine that
it is due to a bug or limitation of the Eclipse to Gradle importer,
please file a bug at http://b.android.com with category
Component-Tools.
